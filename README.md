## Movie quotes
<p align="left">
    This site has two pages. On the first page randomly appears
    a movie and a quote from that film. We can move from the first 
    page to another, where will be a list of quotes from a specific
    movie. Also the site has an admin panel, where he / she can add, 
    delete or edit movies and quotes.
